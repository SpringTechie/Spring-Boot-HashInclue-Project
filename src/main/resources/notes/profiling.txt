profiles(Environment) in SpringBoot:

SpringBoot profiles:

In RealTime an application before going to prod environment , it undergoes into diff Environments such as
DEV : for developers
QA  : for testes to test
STAGE: it is like a preprod.
PROD: Live Environment.

So for each environment we have diff configurations for example:
for Dev env we have diff mysql db and its username and password.
for Stage env we have diff mysql db and its username and password.

To achieve this we have to use SpringBoot provides profiles which allows us to configure diff env by specifying
separate files , beans,and configuration.

Implementation:
Create diff properties file for each env like
application-dev.properties
application-prod.properties
application-stage.properties
application-qa.properties

How to activate profile
In Application properties specify this property to activate the env
spring.profiles.active = dev

if any property is changes for each env, then use the profile concept.

if we mention the above property , while application starting spring boot checks the above property and reads the
corresponding profile properties.
if no profile is set , springBoot uses the application.properties or application.yml
If no property overridden in env , then springBoot uses the default value from application.properties.

By using profiles we can create beans by specifying env in @Profile annotation.
Example: @Profile("dev")
